# Expressiveness
This lesson is focused in what we can compute with a NN. 

Suppose we have a single layer NN.

For the moment, let's suppose that we have a binary function as an activation function:

The bias allow us to _fix_ the _threshold_ that we're _interested_ in. 

## Hyperplane
The set of points:

defines a hyperplane in the space of the variables $x_i$.

The _hyperplane_ divides the space in _two parts_: 
- to one of them (above the line) the perceptron gives value 1,
- to the other (below the line) value 0.

### NN logical connections

and the answer is...

But we _cant_ represent _every_ circuit with a linear perceptron (i.e. XOR).  

Can we recognize these patterns with a perceptron (aka binary threshold)?

__No__, each pixel should individually contribute to the classification, that is not the case (more in the next slides). 
So considering more than one pixel at a time it's not a linear task. 

Let us e.g. consider the first pixel, and suppose it is black (the white case is symmetric).

does this improve our knowledge for the purposes of classification?
No, since we have still the same probability to have a good or a bad example.

##### MNIST Example
Can we address digit recognition with linear tools? (perceptrons, logistic regression, . . . )
When we want to use a linear technique for learning, we have to ask ourself, is each one of the features informative by itself or should consider them in a particular context?![[Screenshot_20230301_153648.png]]

## Multi-layer perceptrons
- we know we can _compute nand_ with a perceptron 
- we know that nand is logically complete (i.e. we can compute any connective with nands)
- so: why perceptrons are not complete? 
	- answer: because we need _to compose them_ and consider _Multi-layer perceptrons_.

So... since shallow networks are already complete, why going for _deep networks_?
With deep nets, the same function may be computed with _less neural units_ (Cohen, et al.)
- _Activation functions_ play an essential role, since they are the only source of nonlinearity, and hence of the expressiveness of NNs.

## Formal expressiveness in the continuous case
What can we say instead of continuos functions?
- approximating functions with logistic neurons
