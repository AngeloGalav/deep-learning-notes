#### Little insights on learning
- As we know, SGD is not guaranteed to find a local minimum if we dont have a convex function, so someone might find the result of these techniques a bit aleatoric, however, they are not: in fact they are _surprisingly stable_ (the reason for this is not 100% understood as of now). However, 3 possible explanation for this can be related to:
	1. The _initializations_ of the weights: usually, they are very close to 0 and chosen in a randomic way (essentially, it's a confined area of values). 
	2. The _convexity_ of the loss function: it's not rare to have loss functions which have multiple local minimum with values very much close to the global minimum.  
	3. (not proven though) _Redundancy_ in the internal neural network: redundancy of the number of neurons and parameters inside the NN. 
		- A lot of redundancy allows a NN to ignore the parts which give a bad result. 

- In dense layers, in which each neuron is connected to every neuron of the previous layer, the order of the nodes (and thus the weights) is not relevant.

## Overfitting and underfitting
As we know:
- __overfitting__: the model is too _complex_ and _specialized_ over the _peculiarities_ of the samples in the training set. 
- __underfitting__: the model is too _simple_ and does not allow to express the complexity of the observations. 

Overfitting essentially tells us to keep in mind that the training data we have is just a small  subset of the bigger, more general set of real data. 

>[!remark]
> Deep models are good at fitting, but the real goal is generalization
> - With NN models, we see mainly overfitting problems.

## Ways to reduce overfitting 
- __Collect more data:__
	- the more the test data, the most likely the predictions will be similar to real data -> the more likely you can capture the variability of the real world. 
- __Reduce the model capacity__
	- Capacity refers to the ability of a model to fit a variety of functions; more capacity, means that a model can fit more types of functions for mapping inputs to outputs. Increasing the capacity of a model is easily achieved by _changing the structure of the model_, such as adding more layers and/or more nodes to layers.
- __Early stopping__:
	- If the results (i.e. validaiton of the training set) are _not improving, I simply stop_.
		- Easily implemented using callbacks. You can use callbacks to save weights or compare result at specific times of the run-times (i.e. the end of this epoch)
- __Regularization__, e.g. Weight-decay
	- $l_2$ regularization: you penalize the weights of the model using a quadratic penalty, to keep them close to 0.  
	- Weight-decay: the weights decay towards 0.
	- We do this to improve smoothness of the model.
	- In each layer you add regularizers, and you can choose the kind of regularizers that you want. 
- __Model averaging__ 
	- i.e. in Random forests, we compute an average of the results obtained from each tree. 
- __Data augmentation__
	- We add data that we presume that is consistent with the real data (i.e. images with modifications, flipped images).
	- Can have dangerous repercussions. 
- __Dropout__

## Dropout
Idea: “_cripple_” the neural network stocastically removing hidden units (we disconnect neurons from the network, disabling them). 
- during training, at each iteration (not each epoch) _hidden units are disabled_ with probability $p$ (e.g. 0.5) 
- hidden units cannot co-adapts with other units (they are disconnected). 
- inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by $1/(1 - p)$
- similar to train many networks and averaging between them.

This operation makes our network much _more robust_, since the network has to adapt to this strong change. 
Another way to make the model more robust is to inject noise into the data, and check the results with very noisy data (i.e. adding salt and pepper noise). 

# Activation and loss functions for classification

In this topic we'll talk about activation functions on the _final layer_ of the NN. We know that on the hidden layers we should always use _rectified linear units_ (or variants of it). 

## Sigmoid
When the result of the network is a value between 0 and 1, e.g. a probability for a binary classification problem, it is customary to use the _sigmoid function_:
$$
\sigma(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}} = \dfrac{e^x}{1+e^x}
$$
as activation function. 
If 
$$
P(Y=1|x) = \sigma(f(x)) = \dfrac{e^{f(x)}}{1+e^{f(x)}}
$$
then
$$
P(Y=0|x) = 1 - \sigma(f(x)) = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{f(x)}}
$$
In general, sigmoid functions are used when we have to define a probability of a certain choice, in particular they are used when our network has a _single output_.   

## Softmax
\[useless stuff he said\]
When using the softmax activation function, we are trying to generalize the situation in which we have a multiclass classification problem, in which for each class we want to output the probability that input belongs to each class. So, the output is the probability distribution of the input wrt to all the categories of the output that we are interested in. 

In this case, since we are outputting a probability distribution over the categories, our output must satisfy 2 constraints:
1. The output for each class should be between 0 and 1. 
2. The sum of the outputs should be 1. 
\[end of useless stuff he said\]

When the result of the network is a _probability distribution_, e.g. over K different categories, the __softmax function__ is used as activation:
$$
\text{softmax}(j,x_1, ..., x_k) = \dfrac{e^{x_j}}{\sum_{i=1}^k e^{x_i}}
$$
It is easy to see that 
$$
0 < \text{softmax}(j, x_1, ..., x_k) < 1
$$
and most importantly 
$$
\sum_{j=1}^k \text{softmax}(j, x_1, ..., x_k)
$$

## Softmax vs Sigmoid
An interesting property of the softmax function is that it is _invariant for translation_: if we add  a value $c$ to the inputs, the output _remains unchanged_. 
$$
\text{softmax}(j,x_1, ..., x_k) = \text{softmax}(j,x_1 + c, ..., x_k + c)
$$
We could see the softmax function as a _generalization_ of the sigmoid case:
$$
σ(x) = \text{softmax}(x, 0)
$$

# Cross entropy

## Comparing loss functions
The output computed, usually, is a probability distribution. 
- Also, the ground truth can be seen as a _categorical distribution_, since we have a category for each one of the inputs. So, if an input belongs to one of the categories, its probability wrt to that category is 1, while the probability wrt to the others is 0.  

As we know, the __loss function__ is the _difference_ between the _actual output_ of the model and the _ground truth_. The problem is, what loss functions should we use for _comparing probability distributions_?
- We could treat them as “normal functions”, and use e.g. _quadratic distance_ between true and predicted probabilities.
- Can we do better? For instance, in logistic regression we do not use mean squared error, but use negative log-likelihood. Why?
![[comparing_lossess.png]]
Probability distributions can be compared according to many different metrics. There are two main techniques: 
- you consider their _difference_ $P - Q$ (e.g. Wasserstein distance, it tries to measure the amount of "work" needed to reshape the curve to the one of the ground truth) 
- you consider their _ratio_ $P/Q$ (e.g. __Kullback Leibler divergence__)

### Kullback-Leibler divergence
The __Kullback-Leibler divergence__ $DKL(P||Q)$ between two distributions $Q$ and $P$, is a _measure of the information loss due to approximating $P$ with $Q$_. 
![[dkl.png]]

We call __Cross-Entropy__ between $P$ and $Q$ the quantity:
![[x-entropy.png]]

Since, given the training data, their entropy $H(P)$ is constant, minimizing $DKL(P||Q)$ is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy $H(P, Q)$ between $P$ and $Q$.

Some properties:
- The cross entropy is minimal when Q _is equal to_ P. 
- The KL divergence is always _positive_, and it is equal to 0 when Q is equal to P. 

A learning objective can be the _minimization_ fo the Kullback-Leiber divergence. 

### Cross-Entropy and Log-likelihood
To better understand, let us consider the case of the binary classification. 
![[cross_entropy_log_likelihood.png]]

If $x = 1$, then the probability of $P(y = 1 | x)$ is 1. 

Calculating the cross entropy is the same as computing the log-likelihood of Q w.r.t. to the real distribution P. 

##### Log-likelihood
Predicted log-likelyhood that $X$ has label $Y$ is $logQ(Y |X)$.
We want to split it according to the possibile labels $l$ of $Y$: $$logQ(l_1|X) + logQ(l_2|X). . . logQ(l_n|X)$$but weighted in which way?

According to the actual probability that $X$ has label $l$: $$P(l_1|X)logQ(l_1|X) + P(l_2|X)logQ(l_2|X). . . P(l_n|X)logQ(l_n|X)$$ or $$\sum_l P(l|X)log(Q(l|X)
$$
Cross-entropy is really how likely is the probability of a probability distribution $Q$ given $P$.
So essentially, we want to measure how likely is the distribution of the prediction w.r.t. to the training data that we have. 

#### Summing up...
For binary classification use: 
- sigmoid as activation function 
- binary crossentropy (aka log-likelihod) as loss function 

For multinomial classification use: 
- softmax as activation function 
- categorical crossentropy as loss function

## Understading Log-likelihood
### (this part was in the next lesson)

$<x_i, y_i>$, with categories $\{k_1,..., k_n\}$
Let's assume that we have a binary distribution, so we have $k_1$ and $k_2$. 
We have to estimate the probability of $x$ given that $y$ is $y_i$, (that is, the value $Q$). 
We also have a _ground truth probability_ $P$, i.e. $P(y=k | x=x_i)$.
- We could have that $k=y_i$, and in this case P = 1. Otherwise $k \ne y_i$, and P = 0. 

We assume that all the data that is in the training set are _independent from each other_, and so their probability is just the _product of the probabilities_. 
The likelihood, then, is:
$L = \prod_{i \in \text{DATA}} L_i = \prod_{i \in \text{DATA}} Q(y = y_i|x=x_i)$

We can prove that \[1\]:
$Q(y=y_i | x = x_i) = Q(y=k_1|x=x_i)^{P(y=k_1|x=x_i)} \cdot Q(y=k_2|x=x_i)^{P(y=k_2|x=x_i)}$

Let's examine the case in which $y_i = k_1$:
- In this case, P = 1  in the first part and P = 0 in the second term of the multiplication. So, the final result is $Q(y=y_i | x = x_i) = Q(y=k_1|x=x_i)$
Same thing if $y_i = k_2$.

Let's compute the whole logarithm of the expression \[1\].
We'll get:
$$
P(y=k_1|x=x_i)\cdot log(Q(y=k_1|x=x_i)) +  P(y=k_2|x=x_i)\cdot log(Q(y=k_2|x=x_i))$$
It's basically just the _sum of the possibility_, for all the categories that we have, that the label of associated with $x$ is $y_i$. 
And this is also the definition of the cross-entropy between $P$ and $Q$.
