# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Filters and convolutions
We have a grid of weights (a kernel or filter), which we then slide.

Convolutions are very useful expecially for extracting features from images. 
An image is coded as a numerical matrix (array) which can be either grascale or rgb.  

## Filters
If we think of this variation as a surface, we may notice that probebly in that point this repentine change can be translated in a high derivative. We can approxiamte the derivateive by meanse of the finite central difference:

Usually, h =1 pixel, and negleting the costant 1/2 we compute with the following filter [-1 0 1]. We take the smallest possible h we may consider (we cant take 0) In this way we arrive to a kernel, we want to compute teh derivative of hte input image in a specific position, considering the precedent pixel. From the input image we extract the visible contours, using a different orientated kernel. 

In general, the kernel is a pattern of the image that we are interested in. We can have many, complex patterns, we look for this pattern over the input. The weak point is that the pattern is linear, and so only part of the pattern is recognixed. It's better to combine pattern in successive elaborations.
