# Convolutional Layers 2

A convolutional layer is defined by the following parameters
- __kernel size__: the dimension of the linear filter.
- A __stride__ is the movement we want for the kernel along the x or y axis. The minimum is 1, but you can also define a bigger stride. 
	- With an _higher stride_, we have less overlap and the dimension of the output gets smaller. 
- __Padding__: Artificial _enlargement_ of the input to allow _the application of filters on borders_.
- __depth__: number of different kernels that we wish to syntesize. Each _kernel_ will produce a _different feature map_ with a smae spatial dimension.

Each CNN layer has 4 dimensions:
- batch dimension
- width 
- heght
- depth

The kernel operates on all the channels together.  

#### Dimension of the output
The spatial dimension of each output feature map depends form the spatial dimension of the input, the padding, and the stride. Along each axes the dimension of the output is given by the formula:
$$
\dfrac{W+P-K}{S} + 1
$$
where:
- $W$ = dimension of the input
- $P$ = padding 
- $K$ = Kernel size 
- $S$ = Stride

##### Example
- The width of the input (gray) is $W$=7. 
- The kernel has dimension $K$=3 with fixed weights \[1, 0, −1\] 
- Padding is zero

- In the first case, the stride is $S=1$. We get $(W − K)/S + 1 = 5$ output values. 
- In the second case, the stride is $S=2$. We get $(W − K)/S + 1 = 3$ output values.

##### Example 2D
- INPUT \[32 × 32 × 3\] color image of 32 × 32 pixels. The three channels R G B define the input depth 
- CONV layer. Suppose we wish to compute 12 filters with kernels 6 × 6, stride 2 in both directions, and zero padding. Since (32 − 6)/2 + 1 = 14 the output dimension will be \[14 × 14 × 12\] 
- RELU layer. Adding an activation layer the output dimension does not change

## Padding modes
Usually, there are two main “modes” for padding:
- _valid_: no padding is applied 
- _same_: you add a minimal padding enabling the kernel to be applied an integer number of times

## Receptive field
- The __receptive field__ of a (deep, hidden) neuron is the dimension of the input region influencing it. 
- It is equal to the dimension of an input image producing (without padding) an output with dimension 1.
- ==A neuron cannot see anything outside its receptive field!==

## Pooling
In deep convolutional networks, it is common practice to alternate convolutional layers with pooling layers, where each neuron simply takes the mean or maximal value in its receptive field. This has a double advantage: I it reduces the dimension of the output I it gives some tolerance to translations:
