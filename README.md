# Notes and exercises on Deep Learning        

> :warning: **This repo of notes is unfinished!!**: it is missing 2/3 lessons that will be made available asap! Otherwise, """"enjoy"""" this material! 

## What is this?
This repository contains all the material that I've used to study for the Deep Learning course in the MSc in AI @ UniBo (2022/2023).
As of now, it contains a series of complete and comprehensive notes on DL, which were written by watching every single one of Asperti's lessons (and I can assure, it was a pain :rage1:).

I believe that the material in here __can be very useful to anyone__, not just students of this course. 

### Why would I read this?
The notes in here are taken lesson by lesson, and are basically a _transcript_ of everything the professor has said during the course.
I firmly believe that the notes in here can be used as a way to __fully study__ this course. 

There are many features that may ease the process of learning this topics, such as:
- Syntax highlighting for important words and concepts.
- Transcription of additional useful information told during the lessons.  
- Explanations for (some) images.     
- Shortcuts to previously mentioned topics (they can only be used properly inside Obsidian though). 
- And much more... 

## How to use the notes
All the notes are written in __Obsidian Markdown__, and can be found in the `Notes/` folder. A PDF version _will_ also be found (in the near future). 
To read this properly inside Obsidian, you'll need to import this repository as a vault, which is pretty easy to do.
Personally, I think this notes are best read on a laptop or tablet, directly using the Obsidian app.
